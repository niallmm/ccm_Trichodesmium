Source code for analytical and numerical model of the cyanobacterial CCM. 

To calculate the same results as in 
"Inorganic C and pH dependence of photosynthetic rates of Trichodesmium." experiments and paper by Tobias G. Boatman (1), Tracy Lawson (1), and Richard J. Geider (1). Simulations run by Niall Mangan (2)

Run .m file called Trichodesmium. 

Another file called Trichodesmium_vs_NoCCM does a quick calculation comparing against a case for a similarly sized cell, but with no CCM.
