classdef NumericalCCMModelSolution
    % Concentrations are in (TxN) matrices where T is the number of
    % timepoints and N is the number of points along the radius of the cell
    % considered in the discretization of the cell.
    properties
        ccm_params;     % params used to solve the model
        
        % Concentrations. Meaning depends on the model run. If you are
        % running a model with a carboxysome, then these are the
        % carboxysomal concentrations. If it is a whole cell model (i.e. no
        % carboxysome) then these are cytoplasmic. 
        h_nondim;       % nondimensional concentration of total bicarbonate over time and space.
        c_nondim;       % nondimensional concentration of co2 over time and space.
        h_mM;           % mM concentration of total bicarbonate over time and space.
        c_mM;           % mM concentration of co2 over time and space.
        h_uM;
        c_uM;
        
        fintime;        % final time of the numerical solution -- needs to be long enough to get to steady state
        t;              % vector of time values the numerical solver solved at -- this is only meaningful to check that we reached steady state
        r;              % radial points for concentration values.
